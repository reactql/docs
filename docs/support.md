## Questions? Try Stack Overflow first

---
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is a community for helping developers. Post a question and include the *reactql* tag when asking your question, and it's likely you'll get a fast response.

> Note: ReactQL is a new framework, so if this tag doesn't already exist, you'll need 1,500+ reputation points on the site to create it. If you're new to S.O, simply use another tag, like 'react' or 'graphql' as needed

If your question is of a generic nature and doesn't relate strictly to ReactQL - for example, if it's more closely concerned with GraphQL, React or another piece of the stack - use related tags to solicit quicker responses from the wider community.

## Spotted a bug?

Bug related to the ReactQL kit? The [ReactQL kit issue tracker](https://github.com/reactql/kit/issues) is the one to use.
